-Improve the cmd parser (try using optparse-applicative)
-Map_union
-Better method for logging (error stops the program, not everything should be IO)
-add constants as uninterpreted functions that take no args (declare-const name val)
-Rework binary op, unary op system to make adding new var-arg operands easier?
-Create Multikey Map

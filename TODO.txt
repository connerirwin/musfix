Conner
-Change constants from no-arg functions to something that can take a value
-Add distinct var support: update z3Env in init solver, use mkDistinct, lit00.smt2_
-Constuctor function export: turn data constructors into uninterpreted functions

Kevin
-Change IO to generate something internally so can use unit testing
-Unit testing through stack test, haskell tags
-Convert map_select to binOp (this might mess with the z3 bindings)
-Map_union

Misc
-Improve the cmd parser (try using optparse-applicative)
-Better method for logging (error stops the program, not everything should be IO)

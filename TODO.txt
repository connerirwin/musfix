-Convert map_select to binOp (this might mess with the z3 bindings)
-Improve the cmd parser (try using optparse-applicative)
-Map_union
-Better method for logging (error stops the program, not everything should be IO)


-Set_sng => Set
-turn data constructors into uninterpreted functions
-horn solver preamble? distinct vars
